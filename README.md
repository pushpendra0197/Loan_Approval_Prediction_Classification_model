I made  Loan_Prediction model after checking with all supervised classification machine learning algorithm and choose best accuracy and precision given algorithm. 
For this project I have taken help of Tkinter module for GUI.
Steps taken for this project-
•	Loaded all libraries for Transformation, Visualization and Algorithms.
•	Import data in Jupiter.
•	Performed data cleaning(removes duplicates, handle null values, checked features Datatypes)
•	Performed EDA for better data understanding
•	Plotted some kind of graph for checking outlier’s.
•	Decided feature for training and testing after Data preprocessing.
•	Checked with different kind of algorithm according to target.
•	Evaluated all algorithm and selected best one on the basis of accuracy and precision.
•	Presented  model in the form of GUI.
